*Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment
  built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript 
  code outside of a browser. 
*NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language
*Node.js for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App.
*Node.js can be used to build different types of applications such as command line application,
       web application, real-time chat application, REST API server etc. 
*However, it is mainly used to build network programs like web servers, similar to PHP, Java, or ASP.NET.


Advantages of Node.js:
----------------------
*Node.js is an open-source framework under MIT license.
*Uses JavaScript to build entire server side application.
*Lightweight framework that includes bare minimum modules. 
*Asynchronous by default. So it performs faster than other frameworks.



Traditional Web Server Model:
----------------------------
*In the traditional web server model, each request is handled by a dedicated thread from the thread pool.
*If no thread is available in the thread pool at any point of time then the request waits till the 
           next available thread.
*Dedicated thread executes a particular request and does not return to thread pool until 
   it completes the execution and returns a response.









Node.js Process Model:
=====================
*Node.js runs in a single process and the application code 
           runs in a single thread and thereby needs less resources than other platforms.
*Node.js is not fit for an application which performs CPU-intensive operations like image
                processing or other heavy computation work because it takes time to process
				a request and thereby blocks the single thread.


Why Do We Use NodeJs?:
----------------------
*NodeJs is built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine, and for this reason its execution time is very fast 
       and it runs very quickly.
**There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager 
*The loading time for an audio or video is reduced by NodeJs because there is better synchronizat
*As NodeJs is open-source and it is nothing but a JavaScript framework

Features of NodeJs:
--------------------


Asynchronous in Nature and Event driven
Single Threaded Architecture
Scalable
Quick Execution time for code:
Compatibility on the cross platforms
Uses JavaScript
Fast Data Streaming
No Buffering
