Error Handling:
---------------

We can divide errors broadly into two types, and error handling into two aspects.

The two error types:

1.JavaScript errors
2.Render errors

JavaScript errors are those which occur in the code and can be handled with standard try/catch blocks,
                while render errors occur in the view templates and are handled by React error boundaries.


The two aspects of error handling:

1.Displaying information to the user
2.Providing information to the developer

In general, you want to show only the minimum amount of error information to users, 
   and you want to reveal the maximum amount of information to developers,
       both at development time and at other times like test and production.

Note:
------

Error boundaries do not catch errors for:

*Event handlers (learn more)
*Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
*Server side rendering
*Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)
