whenever you want to render something on the screen, you need to use a render method inside the component.
* This render method can return single elements or multiple elements.
*The render method will only render a single root node inside it at a time.
*if you want to return multiple elements, the render method will require a 'div' tag and
       put the entire content or elements inside it.
*This extra node to the DOM sometimes results in the wrong formatting of your HTML output 


By using "div" tag:
-------------------

       <div>  
           <h2> Hello World! </h2>   
           <p> Welcome to the JavaTpoint. </p>   
         </div>   
		 

To solve this problem, React introduced Fragments 


Why we use Fragments:
---------------------
The main reason to use Fragments tag is:

1.It makes the execution of code faster as compared to the div tag.
2.It takes less memory.






<React.Fragment>  
      <h2> child1 </h2>   
    <p> child2 </p>   
      .. ..... .... ...  
</React.Fragment>

       <>    
        <h2> Hello World! </h2>   
        <p> Welcome to the JavaTpoint </p>   
      </>
