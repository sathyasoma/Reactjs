it is also know as Hoc(Higher Order Component)

It is an advanced technique of reusing component logic.

*It is a function that takes a component and returns a new Component 

*They are similar to JavaScript functions used for adding additional functionalities to the existing component.

*A higher order component function accepts another function as an argument. 

ex: map function is the best example to understamd this.

***The main goal is decompose the component logic simpler and smaller functions.
        taht can be resused as you need.
