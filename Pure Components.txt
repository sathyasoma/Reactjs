----------------
In ReactJS, 
we use shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle method to customize the default behavior and 
                   implement it when the React component should re-render or update itself.
*React js provided Pure Component
   *if we extended a class with pure component, we dont need for shouldComponentUpdate() lIFECYCLE METHOD.
 
*Pure Component Compares the current state and props with new props and states to decide
      whether the react component re-render or not.

*If the previous value of state or props and the new value of state or props is the same, 
    the component will not re-render itself. 

*Pure Components are class Components which extends React.PureComponent.


example:
----------


import React from ‘react’;

 class Test extends React.PureComponent{
render(){
	return <h1>Welcome to GeeksforGeeks</h1>;
}
}
export default Test;



*By making your component extending with pure component it will get higher performance and 
                  more faste compared to normal component.
